# Support

As you are a subscribed user of our extensions there are several special support channels that you have access to.



## Check the documentation

### [Documentation Site](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/)

The best place to start is in the documentation. This forms the most up-to-date documentation for the extensions and is an important place to start using the extensions.

Common issues include
- Check you have all the required support extensions in the "Add the Extension" section;
- Check you have correctly added and updated any manifest additions (Android) and Info Additions / Entitlements (iOS); 


### Reference

ASDocs document each of the classes, interfaces, events, functions and properties that you will be using. It is the main reference for the extension. If it's not in the guide you will find it here!


### Changelog

The changelog contains a record of all the changes we have done to the extension. 
There are more details in github, referenced with releases but this is publicly available to see the work being done on the extension.
					


## Search the forum

We use the issue tracker in this repository as a forum for subscribed users to ask questions and submit issues found with the extensions.

When you have a question it is likely someone has had a similar issue before and you can find an answer by searching the closed issues. 

Simply use the search bar to search the repository and if you limit the results to **issues** you will see all related questions that have been asked by other users.

## Ask a question

If you can't find a solution in the existing issues, then feel free to start a new issue to ask your question. 
Remember there are no silly questions and we are here to help you as best we can! 
We just ask that you provide as much information about your problem as possible, such as platform, versions, AIR SDK used etc.
